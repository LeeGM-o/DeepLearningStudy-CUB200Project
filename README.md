## Objective
* The objective of this assignment is to develop a deep learning model for classifying bird species. Your task involves devising your own strategies to train the model, which includes making decisions on data preprocessing, model architecture, and learning objectives. You are encouraged to explore various stateof-the-art techniques in semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and transfer learning to effectively train your model.
## Dataset
#### Caltech UCSD Birds 200 Dataset (CUB-200)
* Specifically designed for bird species classification tasks.
* Contains 11,788 images across 200 different bird species.
